          <h2>Let's talk about our data science methodology.</h2>

              <h3><a href="#">Data Cleaning</a></h3>
              <p>The timestamps and other relevant dates were converted to Asia/Manila time. New fields: <i>is_image, is_video, is_reply and is_url</i> were created from columns denoting the presence of each. These values were then congregated into <i>'Tweet Type'</i> which contains a comma delimited list of ['Image', 'Video', 'Reply', 'URL'].</p>

              <h3><a href="#">Text Feature Generation</a></h3>
              <p>The <i>mentions</i> and <i>hashtags</i> columns were created through regex extraction of those elements from the main tweet. The <i>Tweet Translated</i> field was also generated by translating the original tweet text through <b>deep_translator.GoogleTranslator</b> from Filipino to English.</p>
              <p>Further preprocessing removed links, punctuation and stop words from the translated tweet. Words were notably <b>not lemmatized</b> as the dimensionality of text features is within the acceptable range. Reducing words to their roots remove crucial information regarding the tense and context (especially for homonyms).</p>
              <p>The tweet text itself was also split from the alt-image text in the same field through regex extraction to account for the reading experience of the viewers which directly contribute to engagement.</p>

              <h3><a href="#">NLP</a></h3>
              <p>The processed tweet content is fed through <b>CountVectorizer</b> and <b>TfidfVectorizer</b> which count each word associated with the tweet per row and perform TF-IDF for more interpretable results. Only the 1-gram is used as tweets do not require as much sequential context. However, 2-3 grams may be further explored.</p>
              <p>The TF-IDF processed table was taken as input for <b>Principal Component Analysis</b>. This proved to be inconclusive, however, due to the small sample size. This could, however, be used for developing a machine learning model using these features. It was determined that <b>83 components</b> can be derived from the 648 words that were part of the dataset to explain its variance.</p>

            First, the data was distributed non-uniformly so we resampled and aggregated each month so that the time series plots would turn out uniform. The following plots were plotted using seaborn, pandas-profiling, matplotlib, and pandas.

              <h3><a href="#">Time Series of Fake News Frequencies</a></h3>
              <p>In 2016, the number of fake news tweets peaked at nine on June, a month after the 2016 elections. From 2021 onwards, the tweets started spiking again. The tweets peaked at October 2021, the period where Marcos filed for candidacy for the 2022 elections. It could be observed that there is an increase of frequencies of fake news tweets about Marcos’ Last Will during election seasons, those in which Bongbong Marcos is running. </p>

              <h3><a href="#">Pair Plots</a></h3>
              <p>
                We obtained the variables with correlations from the heat map and plotted them in these pair plots to better visualize their relationship. From the pair plots, we can see that the pairs of variables with a relatively high/strong positive correlation are Following and Followers, and Replies and Quote Tweets. The high positive correlation of Replies and Quote Tweets may indicate that the number of replies and quote tweets are indicators of the good engagement of the fake news tweet. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The pairs of variables with a moderate positive correlation are Followers and Quote Tweets, Following and Quote Tweets, Likes and Retweets, and Retweets and Quote Tweets. This may indicate that the amount of followers and following an account has may dictate the amount of Quote Tweets engagement the fake news tweet receives. Also, Likes and Retweets and Retweets and Quote Tweets are pairs of variables that moderately (and positively) affect each other, indicating that these engagements can be observed to increase together in a fake news tweet.

              <h4>Research Question 1A </h4>
              <p>Marcos Sr.'s immediate relatives: Imelda Marcos, his wife, and Marcos Jr., his son, topped the mentions. Imelda was shown as the advocate for the release of the wealth, while Marcos Jr. was portrayed as the one who would be able to claim the alleged wealth for the Filipino people - of course, only upon election. </p>
              <p>The 'foundation' varies according to context: for some, it is where the Marcos wealth was stored while for others, it would supposedly be the institution used to distribute the wealth. The 'government', 'bank' and 'legislature' mentions were part of claims to legitimize the origin of the wealth and its due release to the public.</p>
              <p>The succeeding mentions until 'politicians' save for 'duterte', 'switzerland' constitute those who stand in opposition to the supposed release of the Marcos fund to the PH Government while the last set of mentions contain personalities used to further craft the Marcos wealth origin story.</p>
              <p><b>Finding:</b> It seems that the Marcos wealth story is perpetrated to associate the remaining Marcos kin to the promise of progress - all the while painting a story through the linked institutions and antagonizing those who stand in opposition to the Marcoses.</p>
